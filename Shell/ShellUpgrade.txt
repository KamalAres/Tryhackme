If you would like to "stabilize your shell" for easier ability in typing commands, you can use the usual upgrade trick (assuming you are running in a bash shell. If you are running within zsh, you will need to have started your netcat listener within a bash subshell... it should be easy enough to re-exploit):



(on the reverse shell) python3 -c "import pty; pty.spawn('/bin/bash')"

(press on your keyboard) Ctrl+Z

(press on your keyboard) Enter

(on your local host) stty raw -echo && fg


(press on your keyboard) Enter

(on the reverse shell) export TERM=xterm


Now we can upgrade our reverse shell:

python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")' then press Ctrl+Z to background the session
tput lines;tput cols to get your terminals' rows and columns
stty raw -echo;fg then press ENTER twice to bring the session back
stty rows <rows #> and cols <columns #> for better text wrapping
export TERM=xterm to be able to use the clear command
